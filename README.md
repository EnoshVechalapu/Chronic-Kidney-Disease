## Introduction

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant health concern worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of CKD based on patient data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains medical records of patients, including attributes such as age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, and more. The original dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease).

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted in the .ipynb notebook. Key findings and visualizations are included to understand the dataset better.
